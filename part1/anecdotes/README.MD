Exercises 1.12 onwards from part1
I wanted to refactor parts of the React component into more functions and components but I got confused with when the arrays being mutated within a function are mutated outside
I have noticed later that I use the state differently than in the tutorial, since it put all the array as state, making a copy of it for mutation, and I just let it as it is and make new state variable that swaps between 1 or 2 every time the vote array is updated.
